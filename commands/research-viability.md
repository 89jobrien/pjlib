## Current State

Confirm the report location and current working directory.

!`pwd`

Research Requirements:
- Read project files to understand current state
- Count tests, coverage metrics where available
- Analyze architecture and dependencies
- Identify strengths and weaknesses
- Assess viability (1-5 scale)
- Do NOT use any emojis in output

Output Format:
Provide structured findings for each project that can be used to update the viability report.
