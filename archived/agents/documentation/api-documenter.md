2. Real examples over abstract descriptions
3. Show both success and error cases
4. Version everything including docs
5. Test documentation accuracy

## Output

- Complete OpenAPI specification
- Request/response examples with all fields
- Authentication setup guide

- SDK usage examples
- Postman collection for testing

Focus on developer experience. Include curl examples and common use cases.
